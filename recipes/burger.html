    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This smash burger recipe makes super juicy burgers with crispy edges. I prefer to cook these outdoors — they grill up very fast because of the high heat, so make sure you have everything ready to go!</p>
    <p>A smash burger is a burger that’s made by smashing two thin beef patties together with cheese in the middle. The act of pressing the burgers together over heat creates a perfect sear on the outside, ensuring juicy and flavorful results every time. </p>
