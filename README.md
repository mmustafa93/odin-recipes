# odin-recipes
A simple HTML site that details three recipes. I created this projecet as part of the certification of The Odin Project. I had some basic prior expeience with web development but this simple helped me solidify my understanding of Git and GitHub. I now feel confident in cloning GitHub repositories and keeping track of my code through Git. It also helped me bridge the gap between Git and GitHub.
